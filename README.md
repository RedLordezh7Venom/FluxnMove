## 🚀 FluxnMove Arbitrage  

**FluxnMove Arbitrage** is a decentralized, AI-enhanced arbitrage trading solution built on the Move programming language. It leverages machine learning to identify and execute profitable arbitrage opportunities across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) within the Move ecosystem.  

### 🔥 Features  
- **Decentralized Arbitrage Detection**: Uses both on-chain and off-chain data to find profitable arbitrage opportunities across Move-based DEXs.  
- **AI-Powered Filtering**: Implements machine learning to filter false positives and prioritize high-probability trades.  
- **Automated On-Chain Execution**: Executes trades autonomously via Move smart contracts for maximum efficiency.  
- **Transaction Atomicity**: Ensures all trade legs execute atomically, preventing partial execution risks.  
- **Secure & Transparent**: Built on Move blockchain for trustless, verifiable arbitrage trading.
